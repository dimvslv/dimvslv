👋 Hi, I’m Dimitri (@dimvslv), a junior data scientist and urban planning expert.

👀 I’m interested in spatial data analysis, urban modeling, and machine learning.

🌱 I’m currently learning advanced data science techniques and refining my skills in Python, GIS, and data visualization with tools like Seaborn and Matplotlib.

🤝 I’m looking to collaborate on projects involving geospatial data analysis, urban planning, and sustainable city development.

📫 You can connect with me for discussions on urban development and data science applications.

😄 Pronouns: He/Him

⚡ Intresting fact: I’ve worked on master plans for cities like Almaty and Yakutsk, combining urban planning and data science to improve city infrastructure.
